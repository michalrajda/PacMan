# PacMan
It's simply PacMan made in c++ 20 (I'm using concepts) in VisualStudio.
I used three libraries:
- SDL2 for dispaly graphics
- SDL_image for loaging png
- FreeType 2 for loading ttf
Don't forget to link them and copy dll to project file.
In file "assets" are graphics - copy it to project file.
